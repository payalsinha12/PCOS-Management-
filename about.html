                    <h1>What is PCOS?</h1>
                    <p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal imbalance that affects a woman's reproductive system. It's one of the most common hormonal conditions among women of childbearing age. PCOS causes the ovaries to produce an excess of androgens, which are male sex hormones. This hormone imbalance disrupts the normal process of ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary). As a result, women with PCOS may have irregular or infrequent menstrual periods. They may also develop small cysts (fluid-filled sacs) in their ovaries.</p>

                    <h1>Symptoms of PCOS</h1>
                    <p>The symptoms of PCOS can vary but commonly include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Irregular periods: Infrequent, irregular, or prolonged menstrual cycles are the most common sign of PCOS. For instance, you might have fewer than nine periods a year, more than 35 days between periods, or abnormally heavy periods.</li>
                        <li>Excess androgen: Elevated levels of male hormones can result in physical signs such as excess facial and body hair (hirsutism), severe acne, and male-pattern baldness.</li>
                        <li>Polycystic ovaries: Your ovaries might be enlarged and contain follicles that surround the eggs. As a result, the ovaries might fail to function regularly.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h1>Causes of PCOS</h1>
                    <p>The exact cause of PCOS is unknown, but factors that might play a role include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Insulin resistance: Many women with PCOS have insulin resistance. Insulin is a hormone produced in the pancreas that allows cells to use sugar (glucose) for energy. If cells become resistant to the action of insulin, blood sugar levels can rise, and the body might produce more insulin. Excess insulin might increase androgen production, causing difficulty with ovulation.</li>
                        <li>Low-grade inflammation: Research has shown that women with PCOS have a type of low-grade inflammation that stimulates polycystic ovaries to produce androgens, which can lead to heart and blood vessel problems.</li>
                        <li>Heredity: PCOS can run in families, suggesting a genetic link.</li>
                        <li>Excess androgen: The ovaries produce abnormally high levels of androgen, resulting in hirsutism and acne.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                    <h1>Complications of Untreated PCOS</h1>
                    <p>If left untreated, PCOS can lead to several serious health issues:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Infertility: Due to irregular or absent ovulation.</li>
                        <li>Metabolic Syndrome: Including obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and abnormal cholesterol levels.</li>
                        <li>Type 2 Diabetes: Due to insulin resistance.</li>
                        <li>Cardiovascular Disease: Increased risk due to metabolic issues.</li>
                        <li>Endometrial Cancer: Increased risk due to prolonged absence of periods.</li>
                        <li>Sleep Apnea: Especially in women who are overweight.</li>
                        <li>Mental Health Issues: Increased risk of depression and anxiety.</li>

                <h1>Treatment and Management of PCOS</h1>
                <p>While there is no cure for PCOS, treatment aims to manage symptoms and prevent complications:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Lifestyle Changes:</strong> Weight loss through a healthy diet and regular exercise can improve symptoms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Medications:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Birth Control Pills: To regulate menstrual cycles and reduce androgen levels.</li>
                            <li>Anti-Androgens: To reduce excessive hair growth and acne.</li>
                            <li>Metformin: To improve insulin resistance.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Fertility Treatments:</strong> If pregnancy is desired, medications like clomiphene can stimulate ovulation.</li>
